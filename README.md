# How to connect to Sagemaker Notebook via SSH and run Flask

Hello everyone, today I will explain how to to connect to **Sagemaker Notebook** via **SSH** and execute a **WebApp** from your Laptop.

## Introduction

AWS does not natively support SSH-ing into **SageMaker notebook instances**, but nothing really prevents you from setting up SSH yourself.

The only problem is that these instances do not get a public IP address, which means you have to either create a reverse proxy or connect to it via bastion box. In this blog post we are going to create a bastion box and optionally you can also Opening a SSH Tunnel to run Flask.

The following diagram of this project:

## Step 1 Creation of Custom VPC

In the AWS management console so the first thing   to do is to go to my services then  select **VPC**

![image-20220827235102434](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220827235102434.png)

We are using to build our own private network in AWS

Click a create a VPC 

![image-20220827235238910](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220827235238910.png)

We select `VPC only` and we call  `Custom-VPC`

In the **cidr block** that we want to use is **10.0.0.0/16.** this means that this VPC is going to have about 65 536 available IP  so we can segment that VPC further into more subnets and **default tenancy**

![image-20220828000940100](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828000940100.png)



then we click **create a vpc** , once you create a vpc  select the **vpc** and now from the actions

menu  click **Edit DNS hostnames** 



![image-20220828001327398](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828001327398.png)

and **Enable DNS hostnames** and click **save**

![image-20220828001527505](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828001527505.png)



This will give any EC2 Instances in this VPC a DNS name.

 Select **subnet**, select your Custom-VPC and create a new subnet and i will call this **Public Subnet**. In the first availability zone of us-east1a , we choose the ip address **10.0.0.1/24** which means we get up to 2 to the power 8 available IP minus 5 which are the 5 IPs reserved for AWS

![image-20220828002602676](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828002602676.png)

then click create subnet.

![image-20220828002702003](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828002702003.png)

then  select my Public Subnet and from the action menu click **Edit Subnet settings**

![image-20220828002944096](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828002944096.png)

and **enable auto assign** public ip address then click on **save** 

![image-20220828003112432](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828003112432.png)



Now let us create **Internet gateway** because we want that the public subnet has   inbound and outbound. internet connection.

![image-20220828004137608](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828004137608.png)



create an internet gateway i will call it **Custom-Internet-Gateway** and click **Create internet gateway**

![image-20220828004332799](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828004332799.png)





Then we click on  action menu of the internet gateway that  just we created and click **attach to VPC**

![image-20220828004530794](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828004530794.png)



and we select the  Custom-VPC

![image-20220828004649157](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828004649157.png)

and click **Attach internet gateway**.

Let us go to the **Route tables** and we want to configure the route table now be careful when you go to the route table you must be sure that this route table belongs to the **Custom-VPC** because most likely you will  have a default vpc created in your region by AWS.



![image-20220828005107303](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828005107303.png)



and click **Create route table**, then click on Edit route tables 



![image-20220828005633581](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828005633581.png)





For this project I will  edit the route tables to be public, we add 0.0.0.0/0 

![image-20220828010010204](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828010010204.png)

and we select our **Custom-Internet-Gateway**



![image-20220828010036271](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828010036271.png)

now in the subnet association, we need to point now my public subnet to my public route table , we click on **edit subnet associations**



![image-20220828010636465](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828010636465.png)



and then Select the **Public Subnet** and click **Save associations**.

![image-20220828010654755](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828010654755.png)

and this is from now on this subnet will be act as a public subnet because it has a destination route to the internet gateway .

![cys](assets/images/posts/README/cys.jpg)







The next step is create a  create a security group , we click on create a security group you need to specify, where this security group in which vpc we choose Custom-VPC, be sure to deselect the default because by default aws console will give you the default vpc , then  a new rule and this is will be ssh and let assign the block CIDR  **10.0.0.0/16** that corresponds to all IPs ouf our VPC  and then we add an extra new rule where we choose **MyIP**



![image-20220828111402397](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828111114742.png)

 You can create two different  subnets, one private another public, but  to simplify the things, we I have used only a single subnet. Because the private subnet requires create a NAT Gateway.  But due to I am on my single VPC , and Sagemaker does not generate public IP and has their own private subnet so its okay.

## Step 2 Creation of Bastion-Server Instance



Let us create a **Bastion Server**.



![image-20220828012625443](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828012625443.png)





then you  add the Key pair name , **Bastion-Server**



![image-20220828012652361](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828012652361.png)

and click create Key pair, you download this **Bastion-Server.pem** , then you select

the Custom-VPC and the Public Subnet and Enable public IP, select  Custom Security Group

![image-20220828012816252](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828012816252.png)



and finally launch the EC2 instance.

![image-20220828012842650](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828012842650.png)



## Step 3. Creation of the SageMaker Notebook

Head to the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and from there, under  All Services, choose **SageMaker**.

![image-20220828013008215](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828013008215.png)

Then we will create a notebook instance,

then we name our server as **Sagemaker** . There are a vast of types of AWS Instaces, for our GPU consuming   I suggest use the Amazon EC2 G4 instances that  provide the latest generation **NVIDIA T4 GPUs**, Amazon Web Services custom Intel Cascade Lake CPUs, up to **100 Gbps** of networking throughput, and up to **1.8 TB** of local NVMe storage.

Moreover **Amazon EC2 G4 instances** deliver a cost-effective GPU instance for deploying machine learning models in production and graphics-intensive applications. 

These instances deliver up to 65 TFLOPs of FP16 performance to accelerate machine learning inference applications and ray-tracing cores to accelerate graphics workloads such as graphics workstations, video transcoding, and game streaming in the cloud.

Let us then choose 

**ml.g4dn.xlarge**

which has the following specs:

1 GPU, 4 vCPUs, 16 GiB of memory, 125 NVMe SSD, up to 25 Gbps network performance

**You should be careful,** choose the appropriate instance, to avoid extra costs!!!

| Accelerated Computing | vCPU | Memory  | Price per Hour |
| :-------------------: | :--: | :-----: | :------------: |
|     ml.p3.2xlarge     |  8   | 61 GiB  |     $3.825     |
|     ml.p3.8xlarge     |  32  | 244 GiB |    $14.688     |
|    ml.p3.16xlarge     |  64  | 488 GiB |    $28.152     |
|    ml.g4dn.xlarge     |  4   | 16 GiB  |    $0.7364     |

In particular this instance **ml.g4dn.xlarge**   , during the writing time, you will pay **$0.7364 per Hour** so  be sure to delete your Instance after you finish.



![image-20220828013029935](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828013029935.png)



then we name  **Sagemaker-Server**

**Custom-VPC** amd we choose the first subnet that you can see then

it is important to select the security group **Custom-Security-Group** 



![image-20220828013159248](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828013159248.png)

![image-20220828013242727](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828013242727.png)

and later click on Create notebook instance



![image-20220828013349818](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828013349818.png)

## Step 4. Setup your Computer

Go to your EC2 server

![image-20220828014005578](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828014005578.png)



and click connect and then copy the public ip Copy the **Bastion-Server.pem** to  the c:\bastion or in any folder of your preference,you enter to the terminal, to that folder, in my case I use  

```
cd c:\bastion
```

```
chmod 400 Bastion-Server.pem
```

If you don't have openssh or cygwin, use chocolatey to install it easily using [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).

```
choco install cyg-get
```

**Open Cygwin Terminal** that was installed with chocolatey 

![image-20220823231049150](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220823231049150.png)

and run 

```
cyg-get install openssh
```

then type

```
cd C:
cd bastion
```

and we can test our connection

```
ssh -i "Bastion-Server.pem" ec2-user@ec2-54-84-88-163.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

then we return back to our laptop terminal

```
exit
```

For this project we need to  skip call the .pem file , so we copy your .pem file to .ssh

```
cp Bastion-Server.pem ~/.ssh/
```

copy your **public IP address** of your Bastion-server and edit the  **config**  file

```
cd  ~/.ssh/
```

```
code config
```

with the  following lines in the 

```
Host Bastion-Server
  Hostname 35.170.50.56
  User ec2-user
  IdentityFile "~/.ssh/Bastion-Server.pem"
  ForwardAgent yes
```

then you simply to connect type

```
ssh Bastion-Server
```

```
$ ssh Bastion-Server

```

then you type

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

```
cd .ssh
```

```
cat id_rsa.pub
```

![image-20220828015600997](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828015600997.png)

then copy  what you see on your terminal, then return back to Sagemaker Notebook

![image-20220828015056801](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828015056801.png)

open **Jupyter Lab**, then click on open new terminal

![image-20220828015208138](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828015208138.png)

and type the following

```
cd .ssh
```

```
nano authorized_keys
```

and paste the copied code , then to save  press ctrl+X and then press  Y and press enter.

then type

```
/sbin/ifconfig eth2 | grep 'inet' | cut -d: -f2 |  /sbin/ifconfig eth2 | grep 'inet' | cut -d: -f2
```

and then copy the private ip

![image-20220828020235652](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828020235652.png)

in my case is **10.0.0.20**, then return to your Bastion Terminal

and type

```
ssh ec2-user@10.0.0.20
```

and wuala! you are in your **Jupyter Notebook instance**. For future connections, just type 

```
ssh Bastion-Server
```

then

```
ssh ec2-user@10.0.0.20
```

![image-20220828101904556](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828101904556.png)

If you see your are in ec2-user@**ip-172-16-1-42** , and **IP** that is managed by AWS

**Gresat!** You have connected via ssh to your Sagemaker Notebook



**Troubleshooting's:**

Sometimes if you have problems, I have collected some of the common errors that I found and I solved.

**Scenario 1:** If you **stop your Sagemaker Notebook** and  start  your instance,  do the following steps:

1) Enter to your Bastion-Server and copy again the  .pub fille

   ```
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

2) Remove the saved connections

   ```
   rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts
   ```

3) You can test if you can enter to Sagemaker

   ```
   ssh ec2-user@10.0.0.20 -y
   ```

**Scenario 2:** If you **stop your EC2 Bastion** and  start  your instance,  do the following steps:

1. You should update you public IP in your computer,

   ```
   code ~/.ssh/config
   ```

2. Remove old connections with wrong ip

   ```
   rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts
   ```

3.  From your personal computer, test if you can connect

   ```
   ssh Bastion-Server
   ```

   then type

   ```
   ssh ssh ec2-user@10.0.0.20  -y
   ```

**General Check :** You have to verify that your  setup is correct:



**Jupyter Notebook Side** : You must update every time the Jupyter notebook **authorized keys** file with the **.pub** key of your Bastion when you stop of restart your **SageMaker Instance**.  

Check that at the end of the **authorized keys** files in .ssh folder

```
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

 you have the following:

![image-20220828102358190](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828102358190.png)

With your latest EC2 key, verify that appears the EC2.internal address  at the end of the file for your Bastion Server

![image-20220828102537210](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828102537210.png)

**Bastion Side** : in the authorized keys  file in .ssh folder verify that appears the local ip of your VPC of your Bastion-Server

```
nano  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
```

![image-20220828103004663](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828103004663.png)



```
cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

![image-20220828140024492](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828140024492.png)

**Your computer Side** : 

You have to check that the config file you have the public IP address of your Bastion-Server

You must update every time the public IP when you stop of restart your EC2 instance. 

```
code ~/.ssh/config
```

![image-20220828112313367](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828112313367.png)



From your computer you can check

```
ssh Bastion-Server
```

then

```
ssh ec2-user@10.0.0.20
```

![image-20220828141852244](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828141852244.png)

If everything its okay should run.

Great you have learned how to connect to your **Sagameker Notebook instance** from your Laptop.

# Opening SSH Tunnel (Optional)

If your are interested to run a Web Application which uses for example the port  **5000** and you want it to connect it from your Laptop, and connect to you **Cluster Sagemaker Notebook,** you simply should add a new rule on your Custom-Security-Group , with this port 5000 and  CIDR 10.0.0.0/16

![image-20220828143747287](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828143747287.png)



Then let us play with **Sagemaker Notebook,**  open a new terminal there

```
sh-4.2$ source activate python3
(python3) sh-4.2$ pip install flask
```

then open a new Jupyter notebook and paste the following code and press shift enter

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Web App with Python Flask in SageMaker Notebook!'

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

you will have something like

![image-20220828144506617](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828144506617.png)

and finally go to your personal computer, and type the following command

```
ssh -N -L 5000:10.0.0.20:5000 -p 22 Bastion-Server
```

This will forward port **5000** from your local desktop to the remote **SageMaker noteboo**k through a Public facing bastion EC2 instance, in our case it is bastion with IP 52.54.209.62 

The key here is `-L` which says we’re doing local port forwarding. Then it says we’re forwarding our local port `5000` to **10.0.0.20:5000**, which is the default port of your WebApp.

Flag `-N` indicates to not execute a remote command. This is useful for just forwarding ports.

Dont worry if does not happen anything , that means that it is working

![image-20220828145743748](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828145743748.png)

Then go to your favorite web browser like 

[http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)

![image-20220828150006757](assets/images/posts/README/image-20220828150006757.png)

**Congratulations!** You have connected via ssh to your Sagemaker Notebook and executed Flask.
